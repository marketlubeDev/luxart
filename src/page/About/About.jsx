                  Farzin Ahamed, the visionary CMD of Luxart, brings over a
                  decade of leadership across sales, education, automotive, and
                  luxury lifestyle sectors. With a passion for empowering
                  others, he has personally mentored over 50 young entrepreneurs
                  through dedicated business coaching and training. Farzin's
                  approach to leadership is shaped by global mentors like John
                  C. Maxwell, Tony Robbins, and Dr. PP Vijayan. His inspiration,
                  however, comes from Andrew Carnegie—the American steel magnate
                  who built his empire by helping others become millionaires.
                  Likewise, Farzin believes true success is built by creating
                  wealth and fulfillment for those around you. Currently
                  authoring a book for aspiring entrepreneurs, his mission is
                  simple yet powerful: "Luxury is not a privilege for a few.
                  Everyone deserves to experience it—affordably." At LUXART,
                  this philosophy fuels everything we do.

          </h2>
          <p>
            "From the street to the skyline — we build homes with a story
            inside." From resilience to refinement — the story of Luxart
            Builders is built on bold beginnings, tireless passion, and a vision
            to redefine luxury living. At the heart of this journey is Farzin
            Ahmed — a business coach, author, trainer, and visionary
            entrepreneur. His life is a testament to grit: from cleaning hotel
            restrooms and driving local taxis to working in street sales and
            consulting, Farzin experienced life at every level. Each role, each
            hardship, became a stepping stone — not just for survival, but for
            mastery. Backed by the legacy of his father — a respected contractor
            with his own quarry and heavy machinery operations — Farzin merged
            hands-on construction insight with strategic leadership. His deep
            drive to build something meaningful led to the birth of Luxart
            Builders. Luxart began as a premium division under the wings of
            “Designer,” a respected name in architecture and interiors. With the
            creative support of Designer’s expert team, Luxart grew with a
            strong foundation in luxury design and execution. Today, Luxart
            Builders is powered by a team of leading architects, engineers, and
            construction experts. From concept to completion, we offer
            custom-built luxury homes that reflect innovation, elegance, and
            engineering precision. We don’t just construct buildings — We craft
            experiences. We build stories that last. With a bold mission to
            create luxury living for 50,000 people in the next 25 years, Luxart
            stands as a trusted name for those who seek more than just a home —
            they seek a lifestyle.
