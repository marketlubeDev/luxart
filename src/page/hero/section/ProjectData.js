The first entry point is the double-height living space with large windows framing the surrounding views. Located at the centre of the house is the spacious dining room that connects the kitchen, family living, and the staircase. The residence has a total of five bedrooms, two of them on the ground floor, and three on the first, each designed and placed as per the client's request. The highlight of the project is materiality. Cement texture walls with brass fillers and 3D printed brass partition walls inject surprise to otherwise minimalistic interiors. On the other hand, the bedrooms are more luxurious in terms of design with wooden wall panelling, copper mirrors, and leather furniture.
